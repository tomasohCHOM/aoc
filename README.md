# Advent Of Code 2023 Solutions

This repo contains all my solutions for Advent of Code 2023. Day 1 was done in Rust, but I figured it was too hard (since it's a new programming language to me), so I continued the rest with Python.

To compile and run the day 1 solution, run the following commands:

```bash
cd day1
cargo run
```

For any other day (day 2, for example), run:

```bash
cd day2
python main.py
```

(BTW these solutions are pretty nasty, I apologize in advance.)

**Thanks for stopping by!**
